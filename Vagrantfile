# WSUWP Indie Vagrant Configuration
#
# This is the development Vagrantfile for the WSUWP Indie project. This
# Vagrant setup helps to describe an environment for local development that
# matches the WSUWP Indie production setup as closely as possible.

# We recommend Vagrant 1.4.x and Virtualbox 4.3.x
